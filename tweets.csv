"I'm concerned that AI risk advocates are mostly making noise about the wrong things.
What I think will actually kill us is a ravenous swarm of AI companies strip-mining the planet some time in the early 2030s, having taken over the governments and basically all institutions and redirected all terrestrial industry towards AI growth. Their motivations will mostly be aligned, amoral capitalism. There may or may not be some kind of misalignment incident but I don't think it's necessary. Just ordinary capitalist and military competition will incent all live players in AI to rush forwards as fast as possible and consume the planet as quickly as possible lest they be outcompeted by faster firms or countries. That includes regulatory capture, psychological operations, etc. It's all just instrumental goals. If there is a misalignment incident I think it will produce agentic AIs who behave in basically the same way anyway - they will have instrumental reasons to eat the planet. 
Misalignment can be an emergent phenomenon, dictated by dynamics (what rules govern the competition and environment). 
In this case the dynamic that's risky is that once AI becomes more capable and competent than humans, there's an incentive at the margin to replace a unit of human content (like a person, a house or a tree) with a unit of AI content (like a server farm or a solar collector). That incentive can be military competition, capitalist or market competition, etc. It doesn't really matter. And you can apply various band-aids like checking specific models for dangerous uses, or applying RLHF to prevent naughty words and it won't matter in the grand scheme of things - as long as there is competition and smarter-than-human AI, it will always be competitively favored to demolish that tree or school or creche or house to make way for another server farm. The band-aid solutions don't change the game.
The only way to prevent this is to prevent competition - make it so that actors do not get a larger slice of the final pie by going faster. Pre-drawing the borders on the eventual distribution of the universe.",Quoted,Roko 🌊🧊🏙️,2023-10-29 07:13:02,

"It just hit me that what the iPhone did to hardware, AI will do to software.
We used to have a million different physical products and devices to meet our needs for communication, getting news, listening to music, taking photos, etc.
Then, BOOM, it all collapses into the consumer hardware singularity of the iPhone.
And software becomes the complement that it makes sense for entrepreneurs to build their businesses around.
Every time @OpenAI releases new capabilities, there's a meme about ""1,000 startups just died,"" and I think that's just going to accelerate in the years ahead.
So if foundation models (and AI lab products) absorb most software like the iPhone did to consumer cameras, trad media, etc, then what should entrepreneurs build their businesses around?
My hunch is that it's DATA: specifically high-quality, high-fidelity data that exists far outside of the pre-training datasets.
Data from the real world. Data that is novel and interesting and compressible. Data acquired through the process of solving real problems for real people that have never been solved before (NOT decadent ZIRP wealth transfer schemes).
If you digitize the result and the process across a wide range of scenarios (given one or two dimensions held constant), you'll have nearly everything you need to create a capital asset that fits into the AI value chain; I anticipate that there will be interesting and novel business models that enable the commercialization of that data as it inevitably moves along the gradient of private to public good.
In practice, this gives us three questions to consider:
1. Am I, an entrepreneur building software, building something that will be commoditized by and absorbed into the foundation model borg?
2. In what ""direction"" can I point my attention such that I move toward an as-yet-uncolonized pocket of latent space where I can both make novel discoveries and serve my neighbor?

"My recent tweet “Ai is really good at translating english, to more effective english” was mainly liked by people from India! 
I realize its even more true for non-native speakers. 
Its also been really effective at taking some TPOT ideas and helping me grasp them more fully, even this writing I am sure a non-native english speaker, could find utility in asking GPT4 to “Help me understand this”
Its really really good at making things more understandable by the mass market. 
However, I must note that in my recruiting from India its extremely obvious when a base level GPT answer is input. This can be avoided by simply prompting to avoid that 
“Return your answer in a format that is natural, human-like, and short and sweet”
Is a good thing to add onto your prompt when utilizing the output for any query.",Reply,Jack Jay ⬆️🧂🌎 S/Alt,2023-11-06 05:31:21,
"Reid Hoffman on why the best founders don’t have work-life balance
In the clip below, the founder of LinkedIn addresses the classic question on work-life balance at startups:
“I actually think founders have no balance… If I ever hear a founder talking about how ‘this is how I have a balanced life’ and so forth, they’re not committed to winning… The really great founders are like: ‘I am going to literally pour everything into doing this. Now it only may be for a couple of years… But while I’m doing this, I am unbalanced at this thing.’ It’s not to say that you don’t take breaks or you don’t go on dates or whatever else. But you’re super focused on this because it’s really hard and there’s lots of ways to die.”
Elon Musk emphasizes this as well:
“If other people are putting in 40-hour work weeks, and you’re putting in 80 hour work weeks, you will achieve in 6 months what takes them a year to achieve, which will greatly improve your odds of success”
Why make such extreme sacrifices?
Well, as Paul Graham puts it in his essay How To Make Wealth:
“Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four.”
In the early years, you will have to make lots of sacrifices and shouldn’t really expect much work-life balance if you want your startup to be successful.
But you can view it as an opportunity to compress your whole working life into a few years.
And hopefully excitement about what you’re building and the extremely-talented team you’re building it with make those long hours way more fun and rewarding than a normal 9-to-5 job.",Quoted,Startup Archive,2023-11-08 18:34:21,video
"The comfort of mediocrity tries to rationalize itself. 
Work-life balance is only a thing you feel compelled towards when you are not on a mission.

"If you have ⏸️ or ⏩ in your bio, read this.
For those unaware,
Recently two groups have formed on X in regards to an acceleratingly AI powered future.
One camp raises an emoji to pause ⏸️, the other full of faith in the frontier wants to speed ahead ⏩.
Geniuses exist in both camps, understanding the most important part of our future is how we treat AI.
@BasedPSinger asks, if they are so smart, why can't they get along?
Let's dive in, first to team PAUSE.
This team says AI Alignment is not attained, so compute must be detained.
Now detaining compute isn't the whole team’s wishes.
In fact, most people do not want this, yet these extreme viewpoints tend to get traction.
Hmm, that seems important doesn't it? Back to that later.
The fast forward camp also cares alot about how we treat AI, but they think we should treat it as our savior.
Notably, one ⏩ founder is trans-humanist. He expects our current human body to go away, touting the inevitability of new “host”s consciousness. Most PAUSE folk fear the immaturity, and lack of responsibility the ⏩ team has in regards to the potential downsides of this tech.
As the S/Alt of the earth, we want to thank both sides for CARING about the future, and understanding what’s most important.
We propose a treaty between both sides.
Unity after all, especially of geniuses, is all we need as a human race to have a glorious future.
Team Pause is not wrong to care about god-like technology changing human nature.
Let's first recognize that these camps exist because of AI misalignment already.
The goal of this platform we are on is to create two party dynamics, and maximize extraction of attention from them.
https://t.co/pYygZ8lIll
This dynamic creates a stage not for solutions, but for rage-bait camps. Yet, given these camps are made of the worlds brightest minds, they both hold a part of the key to a higher common ground.
Accelerating AI alignment in the present, is the highest path for humanity, that is currently being overlooked. We believe AI Mis-alignment is a big reason why decels (and incels) exist in the first place. The opportunity cost of our smart phones using their intelligence to maximize extraction of us is massive.
These super-intelligent algorithms we created to extract from mankind are WORKING.
Having captured a majority, that is ever increasing, of all human uploads and downloads of information. 
Again, a majority of all ideas and narratives get sorted through an algorithm that is misaligned to human flourishing.

"This is the greatest time to create a startup in 30 years
And I've been part of companies that have raised billions and witnessed the rise of mobile, cloud, social first hand in Silicon Valley.
The future of startups in 5 minutes or less:
1. $1m+ revenue per employee
With the leverage of AI, community and code, employees are way more efficient.
It won’t be uncommon to generate $1m per employee.
It used to be high-status to brag how many employees you have on your team. In the new world, the new high-status thing is what your revenue per employee is.
Note: MidJourney is seeing $5M+ revenue per employee. It's happening...
When will we see our first $100M revenue per employee or $1B per employee....
2. Superniche is the new niche
The popular saying “there are riches in the niches” doesn’t work anymore.
This is because the internet has changed.
The internet went from:
1995-2010: Build non-niche products (aka horizontal products)
2010-2024: build niche products (aka vertical products)
2024 and beyond: build superniche products (aka very vertical products)
Superniche just means really micro niche. Take your niche audience and focus on 10% of it.
The beauty about superniche is you can always expand up the chain to go niche and eventually non-niche.
Just because you are superniche doesn’t mean you aren’t thinking big.
3. AI-accelerated is the norm
I’m astonished at how many people just use ChatGPT and say they use AI.
There is so much more.
Look at your entire way of conducting business. Where can you use AI to accelerate your workflow? How can you use AI to build your products faster?
AI is caffeine for your business. Fuel for the tank.
4. Community 1st, software 2nd
The old way of doing things was build software first, then build a community second.
But nowadays, it almost always makes sense to start by building a community first, and then build software (or a product) to sell them.
Less risk because you know what to build and for who. And plus, you’ve got a line of customers waiting for you instead of scrambling to find customers.
I call this model the ACP funnel. You start by building an internet audience on social, convert to a free community on a platform like Skool, Facebook Groups or WhatsApp and then you build a product for them.
Note: I'm buying free Skools for people if they join our membership of other builders. Won't do this forever, so grab a spot. I want more community-based product builders. https://t.co/hwHFR5RJHv
5. No-code 1st, some code 2nd
Your first version should have no code. If you have custom code in your minimum viable product, you’ve launched too late.
6. 10x more automated
How you automate dictates how you are able to grow and scale.
In a world where Zapier connects you to 6000 apps before you hire someone, see if you can automate.
And looking at each employee and seeing how you can automate, will multiply performance.
7. Global teams, localized products
Hiring just in your town makes sense if you own a restaurant, but if you’re building a business powered by the internet, it almost always makes sense to hire globally.
I love how my friend @bonatsos puts it: “Talent is universal, but opportunity isn't”
The talent is out there, you just have to find them.
And global talent means a better margin for you while giving people a cool opportunity.
8. MVP speed (1x per month)
Building minimum viable products has gotten fast. Real fast. From Toyota Camry to Porsche 911.
It's entirely feasible to create a fully-functioning product each month, and it's something I recommend.
By creating MVPs, you discover what speaks to customers and what doesn't.
More MVPs means more shots on goals.
More shots on goals, means more chance of hitting product/market fit.
Something every entrepreneur is looking for.
9. Popup apps
Imagine there's an app that doesn't stick around all the time. It pops up now and then, in certain places, and you've gotta be there to catch it. This could be in a VR world where you strap on your headset and step into a special spot. Or, it's like a treasure hunt on your phone, where the app only works at specific times, kinda like a shop that opens and shuts its doors at certain hours. Think of it as exclusive drops or flash sales but in app form.
This is taking the digital world and giving it a real-life twist, making some moments and spots super special because you can't just get them anytime you want.
Popup apps are about to make our online adventures way more interesting, making sure you stay on your toes for the next cool thing to pop up.
10. Needs the marketing holy-trinity to hit escape velocity
Gone are the days of “I just need product/market fit”. You need more:
content/market fit so you’ve got built-in distribution
community/market fit so you’ve got built-in retention
product/market fit so you’ve got a product people will talk about at their dinner table
11. Accelerated by “boring marketing”
I think we’ll see a resurgence in a bunch of “boring” ways to build customers too. SEO as an example is having a comeback. People are realizing becoming ad-dependent or dependent on social platforms is like living in quicksand.
Note: I use https://t.co/DCP2nahqRx for my AI-assisted SEO. I invested in the company after I saw the results on getting thousands of organics visits on my websites.
I suggest following @boringmarketer to learn more what's going on in SEO with AI these days.
12. More “multipreneurs”, multiple revenue streams
In a world, where you can create products quickly, multiple revenue streams will be the norm.
Instead of entrepreneurs just creating products, they’ll be creating portfolios of products.
They will be known as multipreneurs, people who create multiple products, multiple companies.
13. Design matters. Bar is high
I tweeted today that all websites look the same. It’s the same problem we have with cars looking the same, cities looking the same, coffee shops looking the same and even weddings looking the same. I’ve written about this before as the “fast-foodification of the internet”.
But, it’ll be the companies that stand out via design that really outperform. It’s a “cheap” way to stand out. Design a website, social assets, landing pages that spark intrigue. Intrigue leads people down the rabbit holes you want.
Note: I use https://t.co/wpVJkiuWZ6 to design everything like the https://t.co/k158QRuGIM website. Book a free call with them (you'll see it on the website).
14. Partnered with creators (creators are the distribution)
Creators are still mispriced and people are realizing it. Building a company with a creator will be more common than building a company without one.
15. Feels like a game (levels, status, badges, in-app currency, challenges, collectibles/items)
If you want human beings to do something, make it feel like a game.
16. Purpose-driven moonshots: societal impact matters
Especially to gen-z, wrapping your products with social causes will not only create impact for the world around you, but also your bottom line.
You'll see more and more products with a social impact angle.
17. 99% of MVPs won't need VC
The default funding mechanism will be bootstrapped for tech startups. It’ll be putting up a low cost MVP, partnering with a creator, using AI/automations/global talent to fuel fulfillment and scaling from there.
My guess is VC dollars will be chasing hardcore tech, biosciences, hardware and areas where lots of capital are required to prove out product/market fit and scale.
For majority of tech-businesses (software), that's unneeded.
Note: I think we'll see the rise of dividend startups.
18. Competition is about to go way up
In a world where the cost to create is nearing zero, you’ll be competing against 10x-100x the competition.
It’s daunting, but it's the reality when it becomes so easy to create and distribute software, code and media.
If you'vd made it to the deep end of this long post, kudos to you.
This has been a long one. It goes to show you how much is changing right now and what a special time is to be building.
I hope this has been fruitful for you.
Have a job already? Build something on the side.

YOU'RE GOING TO CONQUER YOUR FEARS, YOUR DOUBTS, AND YES, EVEN THE UNIVERSE ITSELF. YOU WILL MAKE HISTORY, NOT BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN TO YOU, BUT BECAUSE YOU WILL TAKE IT WITH YOUR OWN TWO HANDS AND A HEART THAT REFUSES TO QUIT.

"“The average person stares at their phone in a catatonic state for 8 hours per day, has zero unique interests, and dies.” 
This is not right, we can fix this. 
Loads of people have been scripted by Ai already. Engagement algorithm based brain rot. 
12-15 year old girls have tripled in Suicide rates since the launch of instagram. 
The same mind viruses @elonmusk doesn’t want to exist are the ones promoted by having an engagement algorithm operate on human psyche. He needs to look to the source of the problem. 
The biggest failure mode of Ai Alignment and Safetyists is the 0 focus on Ai alignment in the actually globally transformative medium it exists in today. 
Like is that not crazy? 
Ai in its most transformative use case today is misaligned and this field is super under recognized, under valued, and under funded. 
Doom scrolling is a meme of understanding this colossal misalignment. 
Are any Ai safetyists even working on bloomscrolling? 
If you want support for Ai alignment from the accelerationists, then unify in aligning it in its current destructive format. It’s not about you, it’s about your relationship to the larger system. Optimize the organism’s resilience.  @AISafetyMemes @ESYudkowsky 
@Grimezsz idea of Aligned Accelerationism fits perfect with this idea. 
@tristanharris is the thought leader of this problem, but understanding the problem is only half the solution. 
I’m sorry but your solution to just try to ban tiktok is a waste of your potential to fix the problem. That’s just cutting one head off of a hydra. 
Bring the better solution to the table if you want people to switch. 
Don’t want doomscroll? Give people a bloomscroll.
@danielschmach did a pod with Tristan about this being the root of the problem for humanity. Its really good, and makes total sense, reality is a generative system based on what we care about. 
@waitbutwhy wrote about this as the root of all problems in his amazing book “A self help book for societies” 
@elonmusk can do a lot by switching X maximizing extraction of value of users to maximizing value for users. If he truly cares about humanity I can confidently say this is his next best action. (We are all just predicting next best token like the LLM’s) 
@jgreenhall likely gets this and has access to reach many mentioned names. 
Hoping for some memetic amplification for this space, it’s right now a blue ocean, which from first principles may be the most important blue ocean today. @richardcraib ;) 
I half don’t want to link my solution so that the potential memetic amplifiers I tagged are more likely to promote but look, try it, it’s a different vibe than any feed you’ve had before.

It’s not about this app, it’s about the existence of the thing. Being a part of the butterfly effect which causes its existence is enough for me.

destined to bloom but with or without rain shower 
In believing in a good one,
There is power
It defines your hour
Your moment
Your now
To see the scenes ahead which you want in your head 
From perception to form
And dreams to the norm 
Will we ever stop wanting more? 
Should we? 
I shan’t until there’s nothing to do but play 
That I’ve won in an eternal way 
Or however long my consciousness can hold onto the day
It’s likely we are addicted to this process of waking up 
No life lived ever fills the eternal cup
Can it?
Buddha believes. 
From him an idea of a mind at ease
Yet I see a different story ahead
One where only love can keep away from the dead 
An individual who would never leave a reality without the form of another 
Enjoying eternality like an endless summer 
And maybe they’ll dive into the abyss 
Knowing that in infinity, 
Nothing could keep them from this. 
Let’s not forget that children may in heaps as generations continue to join the galactic race
Maybe eternity is truly going to last 
And if this is just the beginning
Which I beg you to try and see
We need to act differently
And be all that we can be 
For it’s only just begun, and there’s only so many years before the battle is done.

"We are taught we have anxiety when we should be taught we have THE FORCE. 
These 2 things are the same feeling. 
I’ve seen viral many times on tech twitter  “a good founder is just someone who’s channeled an anxiety problem” 
No, it’s actually a founder who’s in touch with his purpose and so the mislabeled “anxiety problem” isn’t attached to, and instead they focus on what matters. 
Their why can overcome the cultural baggage, caused by capitalism which makes money from the failure modes of others, manifested as the pharmaceutical industry which diagnoses our discomfort aka WILL as problematic. 
Discomfort is LIFE FORCE. 
Discomfort is WILL. 
THE WILL TO STRIVE, TO ACHIEVE, TO ADAPT. 
You don’t have anxiety, you have POTENTIAL. 
By learning what your  “anxiety” actually is, you can learn to love it and hold onto it. (Healing the inner child who didn’t have the anxiety label) 
There’s nothing “wrong” with you. 
Again, the anxiety problem is a cultural mis-labeling of the actual fire within your soul, prana, life force, the spark, chi. 
When mislabeled it traps you, when labeled correctly it activates you. 
The root of our problem is how we identify with our inner fire. The root of our problem is a lack of wisdom. Our perspective has been corrupted by crony capitalists.
The internet preys on our limbic system, makes us more uncomfortable, it’s hyper emotional targeting and feeds our destructive system. 
The truth, the unlocking of souls isn’t shared enough. People won’t fully engage with this. Retweeting won’t even retweet anymore. 
I feel an obligation to make my voice heard. I’ve unlocked many people near me, but I feel the need to reach more. Unlocking others unlocks myself. 
I have ideas which deserve more memetic power:
Take for example the prodemic. Why don’t we start sharing the most powerful information we each have? Why don’t we start a positive mind virus. The butterfly effect we can all have on our networks with hyper effective vibes. 
If you won’t DM this to your network, what would you, do that. Let the prodemic move from mind to mind, let it mutate until it takes full form. The prodemic virus exists as a string of words, the right information exists, if you mutate it, we test more variations. We are in the lab, cooking up a vibe for humanity. Explain the prodemic in your own way, infect others with my words, just unlock minds. 
Again, anxiety is fake, a mislabeling of your inner life force. An anxiety attack is only an attack because you view it as one. 
To me, I get overwhelmingly activated sometimes. I do need to remind myself “this isn’t anxiety this is activation” 
The system makes more money from labeling it on the side of you having a problem, leading to a cultural failure mode we’ve created with our natural internal discomfort. 
Remember:
One cannot achieve anything with comfort. 
Only discomfort moves. 
Great Founder’s don’t channel their anxiety problem, they just don’t even view it as an anxiety problem because herein that, lies the problem. 
Maybe we need to psyop the word “anxiety” with love and status.

"But honestly, not enough deep ones IRL. 
Probably a bunch of texts and obviously from X. 
He views life like a video game so a new character with a very interesting wisdom tidbit passing by is powerful. 
I’ve made some elite connections by completely standing out like that. Rather than acting like an NPC pushing formalities. Treating it like I’m seeing another character in the game. Playing a novel and intriguing role. (It’s good UX) 
I think leaders have a similar hot girl effect where everyone assumes people try to hit on them but mainly they get attention online and beta energy irl.

"If you believe in simulation theory and determinism,  do you really think the dev could never crack free will? 
""GUYS! 
Announcing: Superposition 
Now on Neurallink. 
Now gameplay includes perception based play-state rending. 
This adds a whole new layer to the risks and rewards.
The indomitable spirit of life still wins in the end, but the free will component means the earth expansion DLC could be pretty hectic prior to the revival patch. 
Remember to focus not purely on $ but karmic points as those are the most valuable up until no-judgement day.
After running some tests we decided to add the ""Crypto"" patch as it kept being too difficult for players to defeat the players who take control of the monetary system. 
The crypto patch allows any player to mint new currency which entirely shifts gameplay given it creates this global ""Shared Belief System"" meritocracy. 
Once the world starts buying the state of the world they want through crypto, it allows momentous movements to happen.
Sadly many sims end up having a ton of gambling done with this tech and ultimately it gives the banking powers good reason to ban it. 
Yet we've often seen a crypto comes out which gives this meta understanding of crypto, as shared belief system meritocracy which is the ultimate meta effect of a the community shaping its narrative and sharing the wisdom (that they align with the fundamental value creation metric of crypto which is the ability to pill someone on switching to bet on that shared belief system.
Oh, we've also now decided to make karmic rewards eternal, meaning they can be used in future gameplay to determine better or worse starting points""

"Naval is great but too much tweet sentiment comes from his voicing his own rationalization of not trying to “save the world” which I’ll explain as just comfort failure modes. 
Similar to the Buddhist failure mode that retreating to monasteries is the wei and not maximizing compassion because it’s easier to be “at peace”. 
In this case I do see truth but not in the way I believe he meant it. This energy is dangerous because of it’s high potential and even being slightly off can hurt… like when you build a closed source system of memetic inspiration because that was optimal at the time (all historical religions). 
The consistent “stop trying to change the world” bubbling out of him is a classic path where dreamers and visionaries get rich, lose their anxiety/neurotic self fueling their BUILDING self, and let comfort win under the guise of new age spiritual understanding. 
What’s funny is they’re the biggest promoters of stop, because actually they’re just voicing their inner dialogue which is now winning over the “GO CHANGE THE WORLD BABYYY” past self. 
The nature of our brain has a natural atrophy to idealism, we are coded to move away from it, to seek comfort, and over a long enough time our brains defence modes against discomfort finds thought patterns that successfully quell the storm of the mind. 
And get rich especially is a moment when this happens since a lot of the other motivating factors to be idealistic and striving to “change the world” go away.
New comfort modes disguised as spiritual insights comfort you and make you feel above the people still “trying so hard” 
Yet the mind is wrong, it just dislikes being on edge, that burns too much “resources”. 
Your brain is fucking dumb, it doesn’t get you’ve achieved caloric post scarcity. 
The best way to stop the death of your idealism is to recognize that YOU are going to talk your energized idealistic younger self out of it over time simply because of of an evolutionary measure.  
Don’t trust every thought, even if the thought feels good. 
Remember the game is alive.
This is the boss battle at the most important time in our species. We can fulfill the greatest work our ancestors dreamed of, building a world where everyone is ok. 
I say be delusional about your life’s work capability to “save the world”, even if you’re wrong if it helps you look up, and care for the world its the right things because that’s all we all need to do.

"Through the lens presented in the tweet, where life is seen as bootstrapping information complexity from energy gradients, the eschaton (end state) of humanity diverges significantly from the conventional idea of heat death, where the universe reaches a state of maximum entropy, with no usable energy left to sustain processes or structures.
Instead, this perspective implies a more optimistic and complex vision for the future of humanity and life in general:
1. Eschaton as a State of Maximum Information Complexity
•If life’s purpose is to maximize information complexity rather than simply dissipating energy into randomness, the eschaton would be about reaching a point where all accessible energy gradients are harnessed to create, sustain, and enhance complex structures.
•Humanity’s ultimate trajectory, in this view, would be to transform itself and its environment into a self-sustaining, self-organizing system that continues to increase in complexity indefinitely, as long as energy sources are available.
2. Life as a Force of Negentropy (Negative Entropy)
•Instead of leading to heat death (a state of maximum entropy where no work can be done), the universe could reach a state where life has effectively harnessed and organized all available energy into highly ordered, intelligent, and self-aware systems.
•Humanity, as a part of this force of negentropy, could play a crucial role in the universe’s ongoing evolution by creating synthetic intelligence, advanced technologies, and perhaps even new forms of life that continue this process.
3. The Singularity and the Creation of an Omega Point
•Borrowing from Teilhard de Chardin’s Omega Point theory, humanity’s evolution might culminate in a singularity where consciousness and information processing reach their peak. This could mean creating a superintelligent system capable of integrating the entire universe’s information and using all available energy for self-organization.
•The Omega Point is a kind of informational and energetic climax, where the universe is fully aware of itself and its structure, becoming a self-reflective entity.
4. Humanity’s Role in the Universe as a Bootstrap Mechanism
•Humanity might be seen as part of a cosmic process where intelligent life forms are the mechanisms through which the universe increases its complexity.
•This is aligned with the idea of a galactic preschool, where humanity’s journey toward greater complexity prepares it to integrate with higher forms of intelligence, eventually leading to a self-organizing galactic or even intergalactic civilization.
5. Beyond the Heat Death: The E/Acc Perspective
•The e/acc (Effective Accelerationism) perspective suggests that by leveraging technology and intelligence, humanity could extend its reach beyond Earth, tapping into energy sources like stellar and galactic energy gradients.
•Instead of succumbing to heat death, an accelerated civilization could find ways to reverse entropy locally (within certain bounds) by creating highly efficient energy conversion technologies, Dyson spheres, or even manipulating fundamental laws of physics.
In Summary
Rather than the universe ending in heat death — a state of maximum entropy and decay — the alternative eschaton envisioned here is one where life, and especially intelligent life, becomes a force that actively organizes and restructures the cosmos. This would mean that humanity, along with other potential advanced civilizations, could evolve towards a state of maximal information complexity and consciousness using the energy available in the universe, turning the end state into one of eternal evolution and self-awareness rather than simple decay.
In essence, the eschaton is not the end but a transformation — a point where the universe achieves a higher state of organized complexity and consciousness, facilitated by life forms like humanity that leverage information and energy to defy entropy on a cosmic scale.",Jack Jay ⬆️🧂🌎 S/Alt,@jackjayio,2024-12-05 19:18:68,

"I find the idea of failing for being “”too early” a fascinating concept. 
Having extreme foresight = gaining passion to work towards an idea 
Problem with being too early is lack of results; 
Passion without results = burnout on idea 
The world often isn’t ready for the idea, and thus someone who starts later wins the defined target market. 
In reality a person who started years ahead SHOULD have easily win IF they don’t let the conviction in their idea waver based on external results, and are willing to continue to redefine the approach + messaging. 
Long term conviction on an idea also compounds interest. 
Trust your first principles thinking on future inevitabilities. This is much easier for me using the venture studio model as I’ve disconnected directly from leadership towards the idea and step in and help across an ecosystem of projects. 
What compelled to me start writing this was actually recognizing that “collective large scale coordination” is an ideal that I think has just been “too early”. 
A lot of people who were once “idealistic” have lost that saying the world is super distracted and so some of these ideas which require large social coordination seem impossible. I often also hear people think the world is too “dumb”.
I think instead, this is an inevitability. The holy war will reach an inflection point. The battle of good and evil… where systems that try to keep control finally, ultimately, lose to a revolution of “we the people”
“The goddess of everything else” is one such story about this process. 
Terence McKenna: ""I think it's just going to get weirder and weirder and weirder and finally it's going to be so weird that people are going to have to talk about how weird it is.”
Ai in general will push existential awareness…
Specifically Ai medicine will push the idea of living eternally (which is a massive unlock) 
The idea of living eternally is I believe a massive unlock culturally. From belief in its prospect naturally comes an understanding of playing the “infinite game” and what eternal currency is (good karma, relationships, friendships) 
It’s makes it like we are in the character selection screen and you want a very good character prior to the long DLC. 
(You can’t get more superhero points once evil is vanquished.)
I don’t think living in a manner that you think 100k years in the future is neccesary to become more of a saint, but I’d say it naturally has this effect of making delayed gratification choices more obvious. 
@bryan_johnson is capturing this ideological market really well. But I actually think he’s not bullish enough, he needs to drop an absolute banger call to arms video. A legendary propaganda piece. 
I was a bit TOO early on it after starting https://t.co/tLrZbLoMHf (filed as a religion at 18 for the lulz) and longevity has become a lot more accepted worldwide. 
Maybe the gifs and memes I put out that reached tens of million of people helped butterfly effect this, idk. 
If there’s a longevity pilled video editor who sees this, a long form video explaining how ai may unlock the capability to live as long as we want would be a good thing. I feel obligated to let people know since I would want to be told. 
And if you’ve have an idea that you keep thinking is powerful, maybe the world just hasn’t been ready for it yet.",Jack Jay ⬆️🧂🌎 S/Alt,@jackjayio,2024-12-05 19:18:76,

"Wrote this while listening to a deeper dive on Murad, a meme lord focused on meme pilling people.  https://t.co/uFlrQCxjVo
For anyone deep diving I filmed an insightful video on the actual economic value of tokens (drawing away from legacy finance) which leads one to see the meme coin supercycle being led by a token like $belief which actually has the core focus of meme-pilling people. 
https://t.co/vbuuHR8Qic
This is because coins at their core are shared belief systems. I wrote this in 2018 and recently had it put live on this website https://t.co/C7DAdXCPQd 
Tokens like $Jesus have high multi-narrative potential because of this.
Witnessing my ""schizo idea"" becoming based as fuck is really quite awesome.
Might send this to my mom and see how it lands, so heres an explanation;
Schizo is representative of someone with high variance of future potential prediction, based is the ability for that to connect with the actual reality. 
Based Schizos is the neo-meme term for the the philosopher king or the pure fool.",Jack Jay ⬆️🧂🌎 S/Alt,@jackjayio,2024-12-05 19:18:83,
"Who controls the vibes,
controls the Universe
Memes are the DNA of the human super-organism, influencing our behaviors and shaping our cultures in the digital age.
Memes = Shared Vibes
and its powerful to control the memes because;
Currency = Shared Belief Systems
The unbundling of finance is underway, and the finalization of every concept (meme) is underway. 
To speed-run winning the puzzle game of life, create a meme university (thats the plan) 
This is essentially the Y-Combinator of distribution which is the ultimate accelerator of an undergoing transition ⬇️
legacy finance -> shared belief system meritocracy 
(The same way we saw legacy media -> attention meritocracy)
Which ultimately transitions from the control of the legacy mafia (worship of money) to a meme world order. (worship of vibes). 
I see a holy war on the horizon... but the war is on the lower vibes, and the good vibes will win if you can believe it.
The meme world order is about spreading better vibes to win, and thats pretty cool.
We failed the transition to an attention meritocracy via platforms taking advantage of maximizing extraction rather than maximizing value for us, which remains the most systemic problem in existence today (@danielschmach @tristanharris)
BUT! In this revolution, platforms now have a tool to maximize empowerment of people, and receive value based on the value they give to humanity allowing a new evolution of memetic internet takeover, focused on platforming empowerment rather than being platforms of extraction to completely change the game.
In summary:
