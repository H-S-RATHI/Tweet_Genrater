"Enjoyed speaking about meme coins, shared belief systems, and the future of finance with the man Brock Pierce wearing our Meme Lords shirts, our stealth venture.

In summary;
We all know legacy media -> creator economy -> attention meritocracy

And it will become more and more common knowledge that we are going through the 
legacy finance -> token economy -> shared belief system meritocracy"
"1.4 Billion views for myself on gifs. 

Showed that Im the top gif when you search ""presidency"" to the RFK team and now we're running their channel, massive cultural awareness on RFK incoming.

"The rate at which persistent people can learn, and create a niche app is unlike ever before. I've hired over 60 people this past year without looking at a single resume or doing an interview. 

We simply give a challenge to build a full MVP of the startup we are looking to create and let thousands of people compete for salary + equity!

Its what I wish I had access to compete in when I was young, and its amazing to bring it to life now. 

I first applied to Thiel Fellowship with Jim O'Neill in 2017, and to be on the other side, helping to find undiscovered talent is incredible. Jim is an amazing human and bouncing board for ideas and direction and I cant wait to touch down in SF in two weeks to work more closely together."

"The greatness of persistence and belief will continue to rise in value. Swapnil Sharma  has been an amazing leader of the OvaDrive Ai 2nd brain project and continues to impress me with his hard work and willingness to tackle new hard problems. 

Great to see this team of fresh college graduates building technology that rivals the capabilities of billion dollar companies like humane."
Bullish on this team.
"The future of social, solving the present problem of Ai alignment. 

Engagement algorithm -> Inspiration Algorithm 

Maximize extraction of user -> Maximize Value for user 

Doomscroll -> Bloomscroll 

Many ads -> no ads

"Underhyped release. Underhyped capabilities. 

Foresight has never been more valuable and the value of it is going exponential."
"Important work. New institutions to help the visionaries take flight with their visions. 

One thing I stole from Nick that was very well said ‚ÄúI want to raise as many people up Maslov‚Äôs hierarchy of needs as possible‚Äù"
"It's an honour to have been recognised as one of the 'Top 10 CTOs IN IT - 2023' by CEO Insights.

This motivates me to continue pushing boundaries, challenging norms, and building a tech-enabled future!

"Social media today will be looked at as the cigarettes of our generation. We have god-like technology aimed at our minds to try and engage with us at all costs.

We platform crazy, and filter the globes information towards the bottom of the brainstem. 

This is the source of controversy, and probably so much more. Really excited about Empowerverse and the idea of flipping that paradigm on its head."
"Check it out! 

55k for a friend from our free grant search software. We also cover the filing! Paid 4.5k to the person who simply told them to fill out the form on our website. If you know lots of business owners, get them to spend 60 seconds filling out 6 basic company questions to see if they qualify for any government grants.

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve completed my PHD in Dropping Out, Completed After 1 Year, at University of Arizona. 

My deal with my parents was that if I could start having my business make more money than them they'd not disown me for going and being an entrepreneur üòÇ

I actually did that with Betarian, my cryptocurrency exchange but shut it down after losing my entire savings and profit from a organized crime attack which used fake American Passports to sign up accounts in the name of stolen bank accounts. That was 2017 and I had done half a million in revenue in the matter of months as the first place to offer Paypal to Ethereum. 

Realistically this should've gotten funding like crazy and we would have changed our buy limits, but venture capital was so foreign to me I did not a single soul who had raised funding. Now that Im in SF its an entirely different story.

This is inefficient...

Switching the dynamic, and reaching out to potentially great founders and finding a way to de-risk their path is such a better methodology for venture capital. It's what I just recently did for Thaneem Rayan to run Employer Grants. 

Proof of this failure is being scouted by many colleges for football, flown out, etc for an industry that makes far less money than intrinsic innovation. Yet making half a million in web3 before it was even a big thing got 0 inflow. 

Not ever thinking of returning to school now that I'd tasted success of creating something I ended up starting a new business from scratch... from my fraternity house, which scaled into a manufacturing business called Cannafacturer which I sold to Taylor St Group in 2022. 

Story of the crazy way that started here:
https://lnkd.in/gddU9zdy

Let me know if sharing my story inspires anyone. I have put very little effort into it, so would love positive feedback if its worthy. 

I'm going to put more time into is, as the stories getting more and more interesting. Here's my new Youtube Channel:

The past few months I've been putting together a team of Ai researchers with the end goal of automating all remote work.

A couple weeks ago I sent a video off to an editor explaining why this fundamental path forward is one of the most exciting in terms of building a company today. 

I also believe this capability display is necessary to existentially accelerate the world on the power of Ai, building our collective resilience by furthering the conversation on the implications of the rise of computational based intelligence beyond our understanding.

Building this company is massive fuel for the non-profit companies I've seeded the past coupled years and the Systemic Altruism movement at large.

That being said, if you know any strong Ai candidates, send them my way. We are actively hiring for Workplete

A week ago Sam Altman said that this space is the most exciting to him, and I couldn't agree more."

Potentially the closest project I'll get to operating a government contract. The US Treasury printed over 400B to offer as a covid stimulus, to employers with W-2 employees during 2020, and 2021 and recently increased the qualifying eligibility for employers and extended filing timelines till 2025.

The video linked below is my friend Jean Paul who after a single phone call we helped him file for $266,000. Looking to bring on board great cold outreach growth hackers."

Just got featured on Yahoo Finance for my year old baby Cannafacturer!

We have been lurking in the shadows for a bit. Committing to quality for our existing contracts and preparing ourselves to scale and now it's time to get the word out. $80 1000mg tincture companies should be shaking in their boots. We are offering 2000mg at $5 labeled, shipped, and sealed.

Happy to work together in our outreach and offer 10% commission off revenue of new manufacturing contracts brought by us!
